# openpyxl

# xlsxwriter
# An alternative package for writing data, formatting information and, in particular, charts in the Excel 2010 format (ie: .xlsx)

# pyxlsb
# This package allows you to read Excel files in the xlsb format.

# pylightxl
# This package allows you to read xlsx and xlsm files and write xlsx files.

# xlrd
# This package is for reading data and formatting information from older Excel files (ie: .xls)

# xlwt
# This package is for writing data and formatting information to older Excel files (ie: .xls)

# xlutils
# This package collects utilities that require both xlrd and xlwt, including the ability to copy and modify or filter existing excel files.

# NB: In general, these use cases are now covered by openpyxl!

# Writing Excel Add-Ins
# The following products can be used to write Excel add-ins in Python. Unlike the reader and writer packages, they require an installation of Microsoft Excel.

# PyXLL
# PyXLL is a commercial product that enables writing Excel add-ins in Python with no VBA. Python functions can be exposed as worksheet functions (UDFs), macros, menus and ribbon tool bars.

# xlwings
